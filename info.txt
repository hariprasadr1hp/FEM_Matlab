About the Assignment code:

Files:

Input.m		-	The file to start with
Main.m		-	The file to calculate elastic + plastic strains
Elasticconvergence.m -  The file to calculate elastic convergence
Elementroutine.m     -	The file to determine J,B,N values
Materialroutine.m    -	Material routine for elastic ideal-plastic material
Exact.m		-	The file to calculate Analytical solution


Procedure:

1) Change the value in of 'mode' to either '1' or '2' in 'line 11' of the 'Input.m' file to switch between

	a) for calculating elastic convergence, 'mode' = 1 
	
	b) for calculating elastic + plastic strains, 'mode' = 2 	        
 		

2) Run >>Input in the Command Window
